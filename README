WHAT IS FROST:

FROST is a 32-bit operating system based on a microkernel. It is written
entirely in FreeBASIC and Assembly.


DEPENDENCIES:

- fbc, 0.23.0 recommended (the FreeBASIC compiler, available on freebasic.net)
- nasm, 2.09.04 recommended (the Netwide Assembler, available on nasm.us)
- GNU make, GNU assembler and the GNU linker


BUILDING:

To build the kernel, you can type "make" in the main directory. You will then
get a file called "frost.krn" which is the kernel.
Building the init-process is very similar.
If you want to get a full iso with grub2 and a menu, type "./build_iso.sh" in
the "build"-directory. You will then get a file called "frost.iso" which is
the iso-image.

BUILDING ON WINDOWS:

It _should_ be posssible to compile FROST on Windows although we do not
officially support it. You will definitively need a cross-compiling version
of gas and ld and you will need to adjust the makefile and maybe pass additional
parameters to fbc.


DIRECTORY:

./kernel/src              The source of the kernel
./kernel/source/include   The headers
./build                   Contains the build-scripts and the grub.cfg
