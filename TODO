- some more syscalls
- rpc

- memory management:
	- physical: done.
	- heap: mostly done, needs implementation of contraction and extension
	-		- could be improved by sorting the list of free blocks
		

- Syscall ideas:
	1:
		- syscalls are normally done via int 0x62
		- a usermode application can query for an optimized syscall interface
		- if there is none, a zero is returned (or we just map standard int 0x62 code)
		- if there is an optimized method (sysenter, syscall) the kernel maps a read-only page to the userspace containing code to do a syscall
		- the usermode application just uses this code from now on
	2:
		- map the optimized code to a fixed location in userspace
	3:
		- map the optimized code into free userspace
		- pass the address to the application somehow (I think Linux does it that way)
		- maybe push the address to the stack at startup?
		
		- preferred at the moment !
